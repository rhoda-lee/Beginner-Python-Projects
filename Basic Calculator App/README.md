## Basic Calculator Using Python
This is a very basic calculator that performs four functions
- Addition 
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
First it takes input from a user for them to choose an option associated with the operation of their choice
Then they input the two operands they wish to work with.
The user has a final option "E" that when chosen ends the program.

## Takeaways
    From this project I learnt more on working with functions and the if and elif statement.
